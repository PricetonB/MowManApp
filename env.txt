make html page for userhub
userhub route will deliver html file
when the html loads in the browser it will link to userhub.js in pulbic folder for clientside js
userhub.js client side code will make api call to server to get user data 
will have a logout button to hit logout route
will have a customers button to route to userhub/customers
make html for customers and make js client file to call server api
that returns all customer data for the current res.user.id


fix routing issues 
make passport init create user,profile,and customers in database.
update userhub route to serve html file
finish js code for userhub that automatically makes call to 
user data api and loads info into html file.
do same for customer button. it loads html file and then js code loads data automatically for html (cusotmer data)
customers will have their own id and when customer is clicked from table
it will redirect to customer/<customerid>. server can use this id to get data from database
here there will be a delete customer button
on the /customer there will be an add customer button 

maybe later customer has appointment data that specifies when there reocuring appointments should be
like once a month or every 7 days or every other tuesday.
this data can be used create appointments and add to calender. 
customers can have active appointments. the appointment scheduler 
will add active appointments if customer is on autoscheduler
based on the customer appointment data.
